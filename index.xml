One of the tools that I use to achieve this is GNU Make, which is a powerful build system that can be used to automate the process of compiling and linking C programs. In this post, I will show you how to create a simple and robust Makefile template that can be used in your C projects.</description></item><item><title>Using Secure Shell (ssh) and Key-Based Authentication</title><link>https://miguelvf.dev/blog/dotfiles/ssh/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://miguelvf.dev/blog/dotfiles/ssh/</guid><description>Installation# An ssh client is required to connect to remote servers. Fortunately, ssh is already installed on most Linux distributions and macOS. As of Windows 10, OpenSSH is included in Windows. To check whether you have it installed, run the following command:

My former college roomate and good friend, Hayden Buscher, recently made a post about the things he uses to stay productive. Giving credit where its due, I thought it was a great idea, so I decided to give my own spin on it.</description></item><item><title>Documentation with Sphinx and GitHub Actions the Right Way</title><link>https://miguelvf.dev/blog/sphinx-github-actions-docs-guide/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://miguelvf.dev/blog/sphinx-github-actions-docs-guide/</guid><description>One of the things I value the most when it comes to when it comes to writing software I publish is its maintainability, from the obscure and simple bash scripts to the large and complex programing pillars packed with passion that are placed in my programming portfolio.
For most people, this is limited to writing consise comments in the codebases with the hope that they work once and never need to be touched again.</description></item><item><title>My Impossible List</title><link>https://miguelvf.dev/blog/impossible-list/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://miguelvf.dev/blog/impossible-list/</guid><description>We choose to go to the Moon.
