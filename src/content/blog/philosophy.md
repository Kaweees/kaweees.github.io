description: A list of philosophy books to read.
---

One of my coworkers at NVIDIA, [Uzair Gheewala](https://uzairgheewala.com/), is quite the interesting fellow. In an overstimulated world surrounded by dopanime-infested sites riddled with ai-generated content, he finds his sancturary in books that are old yet hold wisdom that is relevant even now.

After one conversation, he gave me a "syllabus" containing philosophy books to read. I'm sharing it here for anyone also interested in diving into philosophy. Once I'm done reading them, I might reflections on these books and might append to this list when I find something interesting.

- Sophie's World, Jostein Gaarder
- Plato
- Aristotle
- Summa Theologica, Thomas Aquinas
- Meditations on First Philosophy, Ren√© Descartes
- Meditations, Marcus Aurelius
- Critique of Pure Reason, Immanuel Kant
- The Phenomenology of Spirit, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel
- Thus Spoke Zarathustra, Friedrich Nietzsche
- On Liberty, John Stuart Mill
- The Psychopathology of Everyday Life, Sigmund Freud
- A Theory of Cognitive Dissonance, Leon Festinger
- The Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, Ludwig Wittgenstein (If you want to undergo chemotherapy)
- Camus, Hume, and Jean-Paul Sartre are also pretty entertaining
