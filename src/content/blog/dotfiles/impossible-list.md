The impossible list traces its origins to its creator,
[Joel Runyon](https://impossiblehq.com/impossible-list/). It's essentially an
aspirational catalog of personal challenges, goals, and experiences that push
the boundaries of what an individual believes they can achieve.

The impossible list is not a bucket list, but very is similar to one. The bucket
list has this stigma attached to it which is that if the creator of it does not
complete it, they have "failed" themselves. I would not like to self impose this
pressure onto myself, but have a dynamic long-term roadmap for myself, that
changes and evolves along with me.

I will attempt to update this list regularly, in the case where I complete
something or have something to add, with the later being most likely.
