## Working Smarter, Not Harder

The following might seem like counterintuitive advice, as they appear to require more time and effort, but will ease the burden of studying and make it more effective.

### Efficent Studying Habits

1. Read and Write Notes Before Class
   - Reading and taking notes on the material before class will help you obtain a high-level understanding of the material's contents and how it is organized. Since you have already done this before the lecture even started, your task in lecture to filing in the gaps in your knowledge and asking questions about the material you did not understand.
2. Take Notes in Class
   - You're going to class anyways! Taking notes forces you to pay attention to the lecture and helps you remember the material better. You have an abriged version of what the professor emphasized in class, and thus you have a better idea of what to focus on when studying for exams by the person who either made the exam or knows its contents and answers.
3. Review and Revise Notes After Class
   - Reviewing your notes after class helps you remember the material better and helps you identify any gaps in your knowledge. It also helps you identify any questions you might have about the material, which you can ask your professor or TA about during office hours.


The trick to studying is to studying smarter, not harder is doing it in such a way that requires less stress, cramming, and craziness at the end of the semester. 

## Making the Course Easier

1. Divide the Course Topics into the Easy and Hard Topics
   - Write down the topics you find easy, which you will review less and study indpendently.
   - Write down the topics you find hard and translate into questions. Go to office hours and have them answered by your professor in excruciating detail.
   - The way that you approach doing the coursework determines the difficulty of the course for you.
2. In Open Note Course, Write Notes
   - In open note courses, write notes on the material covered. Before exams, review and make mental pointers of where topics are located in your notes. This will help you find the answers to questions you might have on the exam.
   - Using notes from classmates is a quick way to sign your own death warrant, just write them youself. If not, you're fighting an uphill battle of trying to comprehend them. You also loose the memories associated with the passages and infomation ommited from the notes that are found in said memories.
3. Ask Questions from the Exam Question Banks
   - If a class has an exam question bank, ask during office hours the questions you didn't understand or couldn't solve. Spend your time and energy on the topics and questions you struggle with and know are most likely to appear on the exam.


## Self-Care vs. Self-Sabotage

- Self-care is forcing yourself to do things that are beneficial to you in the long run, such as studying, eating healthy, and exercising. If you do these at the right time, you will make your courses easier, thus making yourself feel better and improving your mental health.
- Self-sabotage is choosing to do things that are detrimental to you in the long run, such as skipping classes and opting to skip reading to watch Netflix instead. Doing these will make your courses harder and setting yourself up for failure, thus increasing your anxiety and destroying your mental health.
- If you set youself up in a way that makes your courses easier and less stressful in the long run, there is nothing more self-care than that. 
   
## Try to Actually Learn

- In order to really succeed in college, it really helps to get into the mind of the professor. When the course material is selected, it is organized and structured in such a way it is cumulative and builds on itself over the course of the quarter/semester and course of your college career. 
- The current assignments and material serve to build mastery which is a prerequisite for the subsequent material, whether it be in this course or in future courses. If you pass by holes in your knowledge without patching them, material that uses it as a foundation will become exponentially harder to understand.
- If you really understand what you're learning, you will dramatically increase the chances that you will find it interesting. A lot of the things taught in college classes are actually interesting, and if you take the time to actually understand its intricacies, you're going to be able to discovery its beauty within and your college experience will become more fun.
