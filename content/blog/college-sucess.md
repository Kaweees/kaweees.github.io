## Working Smarter, Not Harder

The following might seem like counterintuitive advice, as they appear to require more time and effort, but will ease the burden of studying and make it more effective.

### Efficent Studying Habits

1. Read and Write Notes Before Class
   - Reading and taking notes on the material before class will help you obtain a high-level understanding of the material's contents and how it is organized. Since you have already done this before the lecture even started, your task in lecture to filing in the gaps in your knowledge and asking questions about the material you did not understand.
2. Take Notes in Class
   - You're going to class anyways! Taking notes forces you to pay attention to the lecture and helps you remember the material better. You have an abriged version of what the professor emphasized in class, and thus you have a better idea of what to focus on when studying for exams by the person who either made the exam or knows its contents and answers.
3. Review and Revise Notes After Class
   - Reviewing your notes after class helps you remember the material better and helps you identify any gaps in your knowledge. It also helps you identify any questions you might have about the material, which you can ask your professor or TA about during office hours.


The trick to studying is to studying smarter, not harder is doing it in such a way that requires less stress, cramming, and craziness at the end of the semester. 

## Making the Course Easier

1. Divide the Course Topics into the Easy and Hard Topics
   - Write down the topics you find easy, which you will review less and study indpendently.
   - Write down the topics you find hard and translate into questions. Go to office hours and have them answered by your professor in excruciating detail.
   - The way that you approach doing the coursework determines the difficulty of the course for you.
2. In Open Note Course, Write Notes
   - In open note courses, write notes on the material covered. Before exams, review and make mental pointers of where topics are located in your notes. This will help you find the answers to questions you might have on the exam.
   - Using notes from classmates is a quick way to sign your own death warrant, just write them youself. If not, you're fighting an uphill battle of trying to comprehend them. You also loose the memories associated with the passages and infomation ommited from the notes that are found in said memories.
3. Ask Questions from the Exam Question Banks
   - If a class has an exam question bank, ask during office hours the questions you didn't understand or couldn't solve. Spend your time and energy on the topics and questions you struggle with and know are most likely to appear on the exam.


## Self-Care vs. Self-Sabotage

- Self-care is forcing yourself to do things that are beneficial to you in the long run, such as studying, eating healthy, and exercising. If you do these at the right time, you will make your courses easier, thus making yourself feel better and improving your mental health.
- Self-sabotage is choosing to do things that are detrimental to you in the long run, such as skipping classes and opting to skip reading to watch Netflix instead. Doing these will make your courses harder and setting yourself up for failure, thus increasing your anxiety and destroying your mental health.
- If you set youself up in a way that makes your courses easier and less stressful in the long run, there is nothing more self-care than that. 
   
## Try to Actually Learn

- In order to really succeed in college, it really helps to get into the mind of the professor. When the course material is selected, it is organized and structured in such a way it is cumulative and builds on itself over the course of the quarter/semester and course of your college career. 
- The current assignments and material serve to build mastery which is a prerequisite for the subsequent material, whether it be in this course or in future courses. If you pass by holes in your knowledge without patching them, material that uses it as a foundation will become exponentially harder to understand.
- If you really understand what you're learning, you will dramatically increase the chances that you will find it interesting. A lot of the things taught in college classes are actually interesting, and if you take the time to actually understand its intricacies, you're going to be able to discovery its beauty within and your college experience will become more fun.

## Read a Syllabus the Right Way

- Take note of the office hours. List them on your calendar, and **_go to them_**
- Don't waste your professor's time asking about the course logistics, it can be found here.
- Skip the Student Learning Outcomes, they're bureaucratic requirements not helpful to the student.
- Form a strategy of how to approach studying for the class based on the described attendance, cheating/plagiarism, and grading policy.
- Write all of the due dates on your calendar. The due date for reading in your calendar should be a day earlier than the date on the syllabus.

## Maintain a Calendar

- Human beings need a place (that they know they will check regularly) where they write their thoughts down so they can reduce their cognitive load from remembering the details to remembering where the details are written down. A calendar serves this purpose specifically for commitments and deadlines, and this ensures we remain sane and not overloaded with stress by offloading the memory of these things to a calendar.
- Make sure you routinely update and check your calendar. If you don't, you're going to forget about things and miss deadlines, which will cause you to stress out and feel bad about yourself.
- If you think you're just going to just remember eveything you need to do, than either one of two things is the case:
  1. You don't have that much to do, and thus you have no responsibilities.
  2. You're going to forget things, and fail at life. You'll be the person who forgets to pay their bills, misses appointments and meetings with friends, and forgets to do their homework. Don't be that person.

## Defeat Procrastination

- Procrastionaion is not a time management problem, it is an emotion management problem. When you procrastinate, it's not that you don't know how to allocate your time or how you should be spending your time, it's that the task at hand is associated with an unpleasant emotion, and thus you are avoiding doing it. Thus, you need to create a situation where can complete the task regarless of the emotions assocatiated with it and whether you have the immediate desire to do so.

Here's three methods to combat procrastionaion:
  1. Rewards
    - Break down the task into smaller tasks, and set up rewards along the way after completing each task. This will help you associate the task with the reward, and thus you will be more motivated to do the task.
  2. Temptation Removal
    - If you have a task with a negative emotion associated with it and there's a tempting alternative nearby, then you're essentially forcing yourself to choose between a negative emotion and a positive emotion. For example, if you have a paper do, which instils fear in you, and you have a video game console nearby, which instils joy, then you're forcing yourself to choose between fear and joy. You're going to choose joy, and thus you're going to procrastinate. 
    - Remove the temptations that distract you from doing the task. Set up a website blocker on your computer to block distracting websites. Do work in a barren room free of distractions, and leave your phone in another room. Set yourself up for succes by removing the temptations that distract you from doing the task.
  3. (Most Potent) Motivation Harvesting
    - You already are motivated to impress people. Thus, you should set up a scenario where in order to impress others, you have to do what you need to get done. Here's how to use that to your advantage:
      - Work Accountability Group - Find a group of people to work in the presense of independently. Set up a time to work together. Declare what you're going to work on, and then work on it. After an hour, take a break and check in with each other and state what you accomplished. This will help you stay on task, as you don't want to be the person who is not working while everyone else is.
      - Public Accountability - Find a common place with a lot of foot traffic, like a library or study hall. Hook up your laptop to a projector oriented in such a way passerbys can see what's on your screen and thus what you're doing. Work on your task. The fact that people can see what you're doing will prevent you from doing anything that you don't want people to see.
