The theme optimizes images by default with a custom [Hugo's markdown render hook](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration-markup#markdown-render-hooks):

- The theme creates resized versions for each image, ranging from 100 to 700
  pixels wide.
- It generates [WebP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebP) versions for each size
  if the original image format isn't WebP.
- The theme keeps the original file format as a fallback for browsers that
  [don't support the WebP format](https://caniuse.com/webp).
- Images in SVG format are embedded as-is.

## JPEG and WebP Quality

The default quality is 75%. See the [official Image Processing Config Hugo docs](https://gohugo.io/content-management/image-processing/#image-processing-config).
Change it by adding the following to the `config.toml` file:

```toml
[imaging]
  quality = 75
```

## Resizing

By default, the theme creates resized versions of images ranging from 300 to 700
pixels wide in increments of 100 pixels. Override the resize behavior by
adding the following to the `config.toml` file:

```toml
[params]
  [params.imageResize]
    min = 300
    max = 700
    increment = 100
```

## Lazy Loading

Images are lazily loaded by default using the `loading="lazy"` attribute on
HTML `img` tags.
