Safe Network is the real-life Pied Piped from “Silicon Valley” coming to life. In this interview with the #SAFENetwork’s team we get to know about the project, what is it, how it’s developed, and more.

Have you ever wondered:

## Does the real **Pied Piper** idea from HBO’s Silicon Valley actually exist? 

**Yes, it does.** It’s called SAFE network and it has a lot to do with the HBO show.

We got the exciting opportunity to talk with SAFE Network’s team about the project of creating a real-life decentralized web. Yes, you’ve heard that right – a team of developers are working on building the new network – just like the Pied Piper’s decentralized Internet featured on HBO’s show “Silicon Valley”.

Ge to know more about the project thanks to our interview with *Dimitar Dimitrov – part of SAFE Network’s team.*

## Who is Dimitar Dimitrov from the SAFE Network?

Dimitar Dimitrov believes in The Clean, Green, Immutable Dream  personified in the Safe Network. Before he discovered the world of cryptocurrencies, he worked in the telecommunications sector for 14 years and had a  small alternative telecom in Bulgaria.

At this point of his career, Dimitar Dimitrov has a boutique advertising agency. In his free time, he is  developing a charity project – **[Sofia.Help](http://sofia.help/)** for providing grants through advertising to various fundraising initiatives. The charity helps children with serious illnesses, street animals and others.

## What is SAFE Network and its purpose?

The Safe Network is probably the longest project in development in the crypto world. It even precedes bitcoin and has been in the works since 2006.

Human history knows two events that have had a huge impact on our development – copying information (the printing press) and transporting information (the Internet).

> What the Safe Network aims to do is to create a technology that will allow the eternal storage of information.

What makes “Safe” different?

In short,

> Safe is an autonomous decentralized Internet residing in the computers and smartphones of ordinary users.

The data is distributed between devices without human intervention, while simultaneously being **secure**, **anonymous**, and **censorship-resistant**.

Safe covers all the current features of the Internet – website hosting, social networks, emails, chats, video platforms, payment systems – including things that we still find hard to imagine possible.

## When did you start developing the network & How did you join the team? 

The project is open source and everyone is welcome to get involved in its development. It was started by **David Irvine** in 2006, and in 2014 received funding from an international community who believed that we could develop such technology.

My involvement in the project started as a member of the community. I am currently helping with the marketing of the project in the social networks and by popularizing the idea in Bulgaria as well, through an ad campaign with posters at the residential entrances in the capital and the big regional cities.

The Bulgarian Safe community is not large, but it is one of the most active. We help the project by developing and maintaining international sites and forums for Safe in different languages – German, Russian, French, Spanish.
