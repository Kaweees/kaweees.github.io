Over the past few weeks of my Spring Quarter at Cal Poly, I intitated the journey of a lifetime, as I splunked into the rabbit hole referred to as the rabbit hole of Linux. This journey began because of the high praises my buddies Hayden and Noah spoke of the platform, how it

I started by using the Standard version of Kubuntu, and after going through the installation process successfully, it turned out to be a bust. A lot of ulitlities that I use on a day-to-day basis were either missing or were not configured out of the box. I never really thought I would have to configure Bluetooth or my screen to scale properly, but here I was doing that. That didn't really bug me, but the deal breaker was the struggle I had with using my Nvida gpu on Kbuntu could be described as a conflct between an unstoppoable force and an immovable object. It was so bad that I was unable to boot up my machine properly after turning it off. I was so frustrated and upset, that I deleted my Kbuntu partition and retuned to the bloat called Windows.


I've enjoyed my experience with Ubuntu so far, and I've reached the point of comfortability that I plan on switching over to Debian. Switching over to Debian has been delayed to this summer, as with midterms and finals coming up, I lack the luxury of time to install and confgure Debian at the current moment.

I have been using Linux for about a month now, and I have to say, I am so glad I made the switch. Not only have I learned a lot about the Linux operating system, but I have also learned a lot about computers in general. I have learned how to use the terminal, how to use the command line, how to use vim, how to use git, and how to use a lot of other tools that I would have never learned about if I had stayed on Windows. 

I have also learned a lot about myself on this journey. I have learned that I am a person who is willing to take risks. I have learned that I am a person who is willing to try new things. I have learn

I started by using the Standard version of Kubuntu, and after going through the installation process successfully, it turned out to be a bust. A lot of the core ulitlities and tools I used on a day to day basis, like the [Microsoft Office Suite](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/microsoft-office) and [Adobe Creative Cloud](https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud.html), were not supported on the Linux platform. I was also unable to find any suitable alternatives to these tools, and the ones I did find were either not free or not as feature rich as the tools I was used to. I was also unable to find any suitable alternatives to these tools, and the ones I did find were either not free or not as feature rich as the tools I was used to. 

I then decided to try out a different distribution of Linux, and after doing some research, I decided to give [Pop!_OS](https://pop.system76.com/) a try. Pop!_OS is a Linux distribution based on Ubuntu, and it is developed by [System76](https://system76.com/), a computer manufacturer that specializes in Linux computers. I decided to give Pop!_OS a try because it is designed to be a more user-friendly version of Ubuntu, and it comes pre-installed with a lot of the tools and utilities I use everyday. I was also able to install the Microsoft Office Suite and Adobe Creative Cloud using [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/), a compatibility layer that allows Windows applications to run on Linux.

After using Pop!_OS for a few weeks, I was able to get used to the differences between Windows and Linux, and I was able to get a lot of work done using the platform.

I started by using the Standard version of Kubuntu, and after going through the installation process successfully, it turned out to be a bust. A lot of the core ulitlities and tools I used on a day to day basis, like Discord, were not supported on the platform, and I was forced to use the web version of the application. I was also unable to download the Nvidia drivers, which was a major problem, as I needed those drivers to use my dedicated GPU. 

I then switched to the KDE version of Manjaro, and it was a much better experience. I could use Discord, download the Nvidia drivers, and use my dedicated GPU. However, there were still a few problems, like the fact that my laptop would heat up to 70 degrees celsius while doing simple tasks, like watching a YouTube video. I also had a problem with the fact that the system would freeze up every time I would try to switch to the integrated graphics card.
