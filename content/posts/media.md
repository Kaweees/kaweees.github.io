Its very rare that I find media that truly inspires me. I have a very high bar
for what I consider to be inspiring. The media that I have listed below has
inspired me in some way, and has molded significant parts of my personality and
career.

lift people to greater heights, and change them to seek or become more than they
ever thought possible. I hope that you find these pieces of media as inspiring
as I have.
