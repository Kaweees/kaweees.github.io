The creators of HBO's _Silicon Valley_ could have glossed over the breakthrough technology behind fictional start-up Pied Piper, but instead they reached out to a Stanford professor for some help crafting a compression algorithm that seemed perfectly plausible on the surface. Ultimately, Ph.D student Vinith Misra was brought in to work on the nitty-gritty details of the algorithm. Beyond the original algorithm in the show, Misra also had to come up with the "breakthrough" discovery for the punchline of season finale. [_IEEE Spectrum_ has the full story](http://spectrum.ieee.org/view-from-the-valley/computing/software/a-madefortv-compression-algorithm), and be sure to check out Misra's complete — and hilarious — [12-page](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&xs=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.scribd.com%2Fdoc%2F228831637%2FOptimal-Tip-to-Tip-Efficiency&referrer=theverge.com&xcust=___vg__p_5703742__t_w__d_D) analysis called "Optimal Tip-to-Tip Efficiency: A Model for Male Audience Stimulation."
