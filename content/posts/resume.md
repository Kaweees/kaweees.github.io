- Do Not:
  - Use a single column layout for your resume.
    - It's a waste of space and messes with the parsing of the resume. The only exception to the this is if you are a graphic designer or in the art field, as it becomes an opportunity to showcase your talent.
  - Never Include a photo of yourself.
    - It becomes a distraction and can lead to discrimination.




oh yes 100%. always have two versions of your resume - one boring one for the computers to be able to read correctly, and one aesthetically pleasing one for the humans.
