title: The Box
date: 2020-03-01
draft: false
description: The box is a Pied Piper product. It is a new product by the Jack Barker-ran Pied Piper that has pivoted completely from what Richard originally envisioned with his technology. If this box seems familiar to some of you, it’s because it’s based on a real thing that’s already on the market.
