Dinesh lives and works in the Hacker Hostel with **Richard**, **Big Head**, and **Gilfoyle**. He possesses a dry wit and skills in writing code, particularly with Java. Dinesh often finds himself sparring with Gilfoyle.

Although originally from Pakistan, Dinesh is a US citizen, unlike **Gilfoyle**. He claims it took him five years to get US citizenship and was asked about Al-Qaeda "like 14 times".

### Memorable Quotes

> "I was already happy you got punched in the face, but now I’m super happy!"

> "I know Gilfoyle probably came in here and puked out a bunch of tech specs, three-fourths of which are total horse shit. Did he bring up the Iranian revolution thing? Yeah, those words mean nothing. But here's a fact, I'm the only one of these clowns that can code in Java and I write sleek performant low-overhead Scala code with higher order functions that will run on anything. Period. End of sentence."

> "That's not really our logo is it? It looks like a guy sucking a dick and he's got another dick tucked behind his ear for later, like a snack dick."

> "I half-jokingly said to Gilfoyle last night it looks like Richard’s gonna suck Erlich’s dick. But that would be reasonable compared to this."

> "You’re probably right, she just wanted to fuck a Danish."

> "I should not have eaten all that Satanist chicken"
