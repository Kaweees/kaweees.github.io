Richard Hendricks (played by Thomas Middleditch) was the CEO and founder of Pied Piper as well as PiperNet, and is currently a Gavin Belson Professor of Ethics in Technology at Stanford. Before founding Pied Piper, Richard was an employee of Hooli. At work he was often an antagonist to the brogrammers. While at Hooli, Richard worked on the Pied Piper algorithm. However, even though Richard created one line of code on the algorithm on a Hooli laptop which would mean that Pied Piper would be property of Hooli, Richard's contract with Hooli was void due to a clause preventing him from leaving. Richard continued to work on Pied Piper until its demise, but still was involved with Pied Piper projects such as PiperChat and PiperNet until the company would be shut down in 2019.

### Memorable Quotes

> "Let’s just think different. Don’t 'think different,' that’s Apple."

> "I always knew I was missing something, and then when someone explained the concept of ‘game’ I remember very distinctly thinking ‘That’s what I don’t have."

> "I'm okay as long as I don't think about it."
