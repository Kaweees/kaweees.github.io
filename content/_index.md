I'm an engineer & entrepreneur focusing on applied robotics & embedded systems.
I'm also currently researching Large Language Models and building AI projects in
stealth. I also [write](https://miguelvf.dev/blog/) occasionally about
philosophy and computers.

I'm a sophomore at [Cal Poly](https://csc.calpoly.edu/) studying Computer
Engineering. I am currently writing drivers and firmware for electric vehicles
at [Cal Poly Racing](https://www.calpolyracing.org/). Here are some of the
[projects](https://miguelvf.dev/calpoly/) I've work on at Cal Poly.

This past summer, I worked at [DeepWater Exploration](https://dwe.ai/) to ship
some [streaming software](https://dwe.ai/products/discovery), which outperformed
OBS, and drivers and firmware for their products which are used in various
applications spanning across academia, enterprise, and defense.

This upcoming summer I will be working at [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/),
working on their internal platform used for end-to-end testing of their
products, from the modular down to the transistor level.
